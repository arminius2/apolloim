Valid HTML
----------

FireTalk accepts a subset of HTML from the client, and speaks back
to the client with the same subset.  A tag takes the format of:

<[tag] [attribute]="[value]"...>

Quotes are *required* or the attribute will be ignored.  Whitespace
is allowed between the [tag] and [attribute], and between subsequent
attribute entities, but nowhere else.

Ending tags take the form of:

</[tag]>

Whitespace is not allowed.

Valid tags and attributes are as follows:

font
	size
	color
	back
b
u
i
img
	src
br

Not all protocols necessarily pass all tags/attributes (IRC cannot
handle font size, etc.).  Anything that is not one of these items
will be stripped, to avoid odd client HTML leaking into protocols
that are not HTML-based.

Character substitions accepted:

&amp;
&lt;
&gt;
&nbsp;
&tab;
&quot;

FireTalk internally compresses multiple whitespace.  Use &nbsp;
and &tab; to represent multiple whitespace.  Always escape non-HTML
&, < and > with &amp;, &lt; and &gt; to avoid confusion.
