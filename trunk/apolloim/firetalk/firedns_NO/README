FireDNS Library

From libfiredns(3):

libfiredns is a library for handling asynchronous DNS
requests.  It provides a very simple interface for sending
requests and parsing reponses, as well as low-timeout
blocking functions.  It can also be compiled to override
the BIND/LIBC functions with its alternative implementations.
libfiredns functions have much lower timeouts than the stock
functions and tend to be faster because they send requests
to all configured system nameservers at the same time.

To build the library, simply type:

	make
	(su to root)
	make install

The makefile accepts the following environment variables to
change its behaviour:

	PREFIX
	INSTALL_USER
	CC
	CFLAGS
	LDFLAGS
	LIBS

You may need to alter these for your individual configuration.

Thats it.  If it doesn't work, I'm sorry.  Let me know; you
